        <p>Reading is a habit that can improve your lifespan by reducing your stress, enhancing your mental health, developing new neural pathways, helping you learn empathy, improving your ability to communicate, and providing you with healthy entertainment. <br> Some of the reasons why reading is important is to foster a relaxed, inspiring, and enjoyable life filled with incredible stories, relatable characters, and the ability to broaden or deepen your knowledge just by picking up a book.</p></div>

            <h2>Purple Hibiscus</h2>
            <em>...what I like to do</em>
            <p>This is one of my favorite books. It is a collection of short stories about living,loving and hurting through very familiar sounds, in very familiar ways and finding healing in the most unlikely places. <br> The stiries are also part-homage and part-love letter to Port Harcourt (the city which most of them are set in).</p>
